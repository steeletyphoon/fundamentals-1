# HTML

Understanding how the web works and how to use it is the single
most ubiquitous tech skill anyone should learn. This is why *every*
school district that has any tech offerings includes some level of
HTML instruction, albeit extremely out dated. HTML5 is fundamental.

The activities in this directory match those of Python and Node as
closely as possible but incorporate graphical elements as the web
is best for. The web is *the* universal graphic user interface and
used to make sites and apps for everything. One could make a strong
argument it is the only graphic interface anyone needs to learn in
the modern tech world &mdash; especially as WebGL, WebAudio and
other rich media web standards displace other technologies (Flash,
DirectX, etc.)
