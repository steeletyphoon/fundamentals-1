# True Timer (Timer Revisited)

Remember our colorful timer from earlier in the course? It might have
been fun to make and taught you a lot about loops but, guess what,
it's wrong.  If you compare the times carefully to another stop watch
you will see it is actually slow by as much as two seconds per minute,
and for a good reason. Understanding why will teach you a lot about how
computer brains (CPUs) work and specifically how they managed to share
the limited time they use. After creating `truetimer` your code could
even be included in a *timer.py* module and used in other projects later.
