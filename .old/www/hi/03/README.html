<h2>Remembering Input</h2><pre><code class="language-python">#!/usr/bin/env python3

print(&quot;Hi, what&#39;s your name?&quot;)
name = input(&#39;--&gt; &#39;)
print(name)
</code></pre>
<p>Now we add a <code>name</code> variable that will have whatever the user typed
inside of it so we can use it later.  The <code>input()</code> function is like
a machine that spits something out. When a function does this we call
it <em>returning</em> a value. We store that returned value into <code>name</code> by
assigning it just like we did color codes in <code>hello</code>.</p>
<p>To make sure all this plumbing is working we are going to just print
the <code>name</code> variable. <code>print()</code> is universally used to test code so
we can see what is going on &mdash; especially when things get more
complicated. Often this is referred to as a <em>debug print statement</em>. There
are much fancier ways to debug, (which means to track down problems),
in code. But the old reliable <code>print()</code> statement is always there to
help us out. We&#39;ll delete it later once we know our code is working.</p>
<p>Using all our fancy new words for things we can describe <code>name =
input(&#39;--&gt;&#39;)</code> as a line of code that calls the <em>function</em> <code>input()</code> and
passes a single <em>string</em> as a <em>param</em> for the <em>prompt</em> and <em>returns</em>
another <em>string</em> containing what the user typed into the <code>name</code>
<em>variable</em>. By now that sentence should make sense enough to not sound
like some coder-geek foreign language. Yes, face the reality, YOU are
becoming a geek. Just own it and start imagining how you will soon use
your new superpower for good. Oh, and don&#39;t forget to go outside once
in a while.</p>
