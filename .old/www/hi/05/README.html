<h2>A Colorful Salutation</h2><pre><code class="language-python">#!/usr/bin/env python3

import colors as c

print(c.clear)
print(c.yellow + &quot;Hi, what&#39;s your name?&quot;)
name = input(c.orange + &#39;--&gt; &#39;)
print(c.yellow + &#39;Well &#39; + name + &#39;, nice to meet you.&#39;)

<p>Time to color things up now that the base program is working. We&#39;ll add
a new special &#39;color&#39; that isn&#39;t really a color at all. It clears the
screen when you print it like the other colors.</p>
<p>Notice that the last line is all yellow. Can you think of a way to make</p>
