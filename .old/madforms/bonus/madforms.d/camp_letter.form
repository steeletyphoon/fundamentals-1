Camp Letter

Dear {Type of Relative},

I am having a(n) {Adjective1} time at camp. The counselour is {Adjective2}
and the food is {Adjective3}. I met {Name of Person in Room} and we
became {Adjective4} friends. Unfortunately, {Name of Person in Room} is
{Adjective5} and I {Verb Ending In -Ed} my {Body Part} so we couldn't go
{Verb Ending in -Ing} like everybody else. I need more {Plural Noun} and
a {Noun} sharpener, so please {Adverb} {Verb1} more soon.

Your {Another Type of Relative},

{Another Person In Room}
