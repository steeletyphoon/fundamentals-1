# Solarized Color Utilities

This is a collection of files for setting various terminals to Solarized
settings so that the `colors.py` mod matches the names of the colors
set with the ANSI color codes.

If you are student who is utterly confused by all of these don't worry.
These are mostly here to help teachers set up environments for teaching
this.
