# Data

Everything is data-driven these days so understanding how to organize
and query data is fundamental. Four data concepts are introduced and
explored in fundamentals:

1. TXT
2. JSON
3. XML
4. CSV
5. SQL
6. YAML
7. TOML
8. INI

HTML is technically a data format as well but gets its own focus since
it includes integrating CSS and JavaScript.

The discussion about data includes using data passed from the calling
system environment, which is universally supported on all OSes.
