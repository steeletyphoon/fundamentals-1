# Data

Everything is data-driven these days so understanding how to organize
and query data is fundamental. Four data concepts are introduced and
explored in fundamentals:

1. JSON
2. XML
3. CSV
4. SQL
5. YAML
6. TOML
7. INI

HTML is technically a data format as well but gets its own focus since
it includes integrating CSS and JavaScript.
