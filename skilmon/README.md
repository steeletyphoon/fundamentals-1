# SkilMon

This module walks students through the essentials of working with
object-oriented classes, reading and writing files, and parsing and
writing JSON data from files and web API URIs. Students will create
the full SkilMon API from scratch including the data classes and
battle algorithm. See the [SkilMon](http://github.com/skilstak/skilmon)
project for the finished code. The steps and code snippet examples
to create the finished project will be hosted here.
