# Step 6: Color Abbreviations (Short Names)

To reduce the amount of typing and confusion when using colors short
forms of the color names are also available. ***Abbreviations*** are
when a longer word is made shorter by not writing it all out.

Keep in mind the abbreviation for `c.reset` is `c.x` since `c.r` is
already used for `c.red` and the `x` means "turn off".
