# Step 7: Random Color

One last fun option is using random colors with `c.random_color()`
or the short form `c.rc()`. Don't forget the ***parenthesis*** `()`
on the end, which mean that this is a ***function*** and not just a
***variable***. The rest of the colors are just codes in ***strings***
inside variables. Random colors have to be selected using the code in the
`c.random_color()` function.
