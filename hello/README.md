# Hello World

![SkilStak Hello](skilstak-terminal.png)

*Hello world* is a famous program written by
millions in [dozens if not hundreds of programming
languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Hello_world_program_examples).
It's a great way to start.

# What is Coding?

Let's assume you have never heard of ***coding*** before. If you have you
can skip or maybe you want read Paul Ford's excellent article:

Coding is when humans write instructions for computers to use. The
instructions are like recipes. The recipes are called ***algorithems***.
Computers really only speak one language, ***machine language***. Since
each computer machine is different computers speak different
machine languages. Remember C-3PO from Star Wars? His job was talking
between machines. (A ***protocol*** is a way to communicate.) We may not
have protocol droids like 3PO yet, but many languages have been created
with interpreters and other stuff to help humans tell different types
of computers how to do the same things.

# Use the Source, Luke

These days most all code is written.

A ***character*** is a letter, number, symbol or space that you can type.

A ***text file*** is a file with letters, numbers, spaces and other characters
in it.

***Source code*** is the text that goes into one or more ***text files*** that
make up your program. Sometimes these files can be run as a program by
themselves.  These are called ***scripts***. Sometimes ***source code*** files are
turned into other files that the computer can understand better and faster
than what you could ever type in. Making these computer-friendly files
is called ***compiling*** your code. Computers can understand some compiled
code directly and some still needs an ***interpreter***. Just like humans,
computers sometimes need help interpreting one language into something
they understand. Like in real-life, it is faster for the computer when
an interpreter is not needed, but sometimes speed isn't as important as
being able to easily work with code that humans and many different types of
computers can understand.

A ***script*** is ***source code*** that can be run as a program.

An ***editor*** is a app used to change stuff in a file, for example, to create
a new `hello` program or edit a `server.properties` file to change
a Minecraft world to super flat.

A ***screen-oriented editor*** is an editor that doesn't need a mouse to
use. Since we are writing all our programs from a ***Linux terminal***
(like professionals) we will use ***vi*** (or ***vim***) a famous ***editor*** used
by great programmers since before the Internet was invented. ***vi***
is on every UNIX/Linux computer there is.  This makes it a very useful
tool to learn.

# Creating Code with VIM

![vim](vim-logo.png)

`vi` is an ancient ***text editor***, almost the first, (which I think was
`ed`). Ironically it holds its position as the Stradivarius of editors
&mdash; especially now that `vim` has improved it.  Its power comes from
its ubiquity. You can find `vi` on *every* UNIX/Linux/Solaris/AIX/BSD/Mac
system in the world by default (no it isn't on Windows).

Here are the survival essentials you need to master at this point. You
will learn many more as you grow into this powerful editor:

* `vi hello` - create and open a new file called `hello`
* `i` - switch to `INSERT` mode (look in bottom left)
* `<arrows>` - move around (easiest for beginners)
* `<esc>` - escape out of `INSERT`
* `<esc>u` - undo, which you can repeat
* `ZZ` or `:q` - save and exit
* `ZQ` or `:q!` - just quit without saving
* `:w` - save without exiting

The secret for beginners is the arrows. Eventually you will use `INSERT`
mode less and less.

Now you are ready to start creating files with vi.
