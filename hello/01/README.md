# Your First Program

Let's start simple:

1. Create a new file with `vi hello`
2. Type `i` to change to `INSERT` mode in vi
3. Type `print("Hello world!")`
4. Press `esc` (in the top left of keyboard) to change out of `INSERT` mode
5. Type `ZZ` (those are capital letters) to save and close the file
6. Type `python3 hello` to run your code
7. Mark this calendar day as your ***code birthday*** (if your first code)

This program has two parts: 

1. A ***function call***: `print()`
2. A ***string parameter***: `"Hello world!"`

A ***function call*** is an action, a way to make the computer do something,
like print something to the screen. Many words in programming, like
***function***, get names from math, so pay attention in math class if you
want to be a better programmer.

A ***string parameter*** is what goes into the function call. This tells the
function what to print.

A ***string*** is a bunch of ***characters***, letters, numbers, spaces and other
stuff strung together like beads on a bracelet or necklace and tied with
knots on the ends. The knots are ***quotes*** (`"`). If you leave off a knot
the beads fall off and you get a `Syntax Error`, which is just Python's
way of helping you get it right. Make sure you read those errors carefully
even if they contain hard words to understand, they contain a lot of clues
about the problem, which you can even Google to get more help from other
humans on the Interwebz.
