<p><img src="https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-generic.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>Meet Python, the best first programming language anyone should learn.
It is approachable, easy, and &mdash; most of all &mdash; real. Python is
a core language used by the worldwide scientific community &mdash; including
MIT where it is the first language taught. Python can be found everywhere
from elementary schools to Hollywood.</p>
<h1 id="what-we-learn">What We Learn</h1>
<p>In this course students find out what coding is, why they should learn
it, and how to write their first Python code the way most professionals
do, with the vim text editor from a Linux Bash command line. Students
gradually learn the same habits, tools, and workflows associated with
college CS programs and technical careers. Students learn programming
fundamentals such as variables, operators, blocks, logics, loops, data
types, lists, dictionaries, functions, exceptions, and basic code
organization with modules. We use modern Python 3 for many obvious
reasons.</p>
<h1 id="what-we-don-t-learn">What We Don&#39;t Learn</h1>
<p>Python-1 focuses on basic structured and procedural programming
paradigms. It does not directly cover important but more advanced concepts
such as traditional object-oriented and functional programming.  While the
games and code in Python-1 are designed to be fun, Python-1 does <strong>not</strong>
use Python IDLE, <code>turtle</code>, <code>pygame</code> or other made-for-education Python
technologies, which, despite their prevalence, are of dubious value in
the higher-education and professional world. Focus is placed instead on
techniques and tools that will remain useful well beyond school. Students
are encouraged to unit test their code often but no test frameworks
besides code bits in <code>if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:</code> are introduced at
this level.</p>
<h1 id="planning">Planning</h1>
<p>This course takes a total of 24 hours to complete and is designed
to fit into 16 weeks of 90-minute classes (a semester) or two, 4-day weeks of
3-hour classes (ex: 9:30 - 12:30, Monday - Thursday).</p>
<p>The pace is set to what an average 8-12 year-old with typing skills can
accomplish within 70 minutes of a 90 minute class. Bonus challenges are
available for faster and older learners increasing the age range to about 18.
Keep in mind, however, that adults are also challenged by this material
(even if they don&#39;t get the pop references).</p>
<p>The last two weeks are a review of all the previous material. Avoid the
temptation to skip the final review since it ensures students are ready to
progress.</p>

<h1 id="resources-and-requirements">Resources and Requirements</h1>
<p>Students need access to a Linux command-line on a computer that has had
<code>python3</code> installed. Usually this will be through an ssh connection
(putty, etc.) to a Linux account on a school server. This could equally
be done with individual <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> computers, individual Linux
real or virtual machines, or a remote virtual host such as Digital Ocean.</p>
<p>GitHub accounts for each student are strongly recommended and the
following function is contained in <code>.bashrc</code> to make <code>git commits</code>
as easy as possible:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">save () 
{ 
    comment=save;
    [ ! -z &quot;$*&quot; ] &amp;&amp; comment=&quot;$*&quot;;
    git pull;
    git add -A .;
    git commit -a -m &quot;$comment&quot;;
    git push
}
</code></pre>
<p>More details about setting up a teacher and/or student environment can be
found in the <a href="bin"><code>bin</code></a> and <a href="tools"><code>tools</code></a> directory.</p>

<p><em>Hello world</em> is a famous program written by
millions in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Hello_world_program_examples">dozens if not hundreds of programming
languages</a>.
It&#39;s a great way to start.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-coding-">What is Coding?</h1>
<p>Let&#39;s assume you have never heard of <strong><em>coding</em></strong> before. If you have you
can skip or maybe you want read Paul Ford&#39;s excellent article:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/"><img src="../img/whatiscode.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Coding is when humans write instructions for computers to use. The
instructions are like recipes. The recipes are called <strong><em>algorithems</em></strong>.
Computers really only speak one language, <strong><em>machine language</em></strong>. Since
each computer machine is different computers speak different
machine languages. Remember C-3PO from Star Wars? His job was talking
between machines. (A <strong><em>protocol</em></strong> is a way to communicate.) We may not
have protocol droids like 3PO yet, but many languages have been created
with interpreters and other stuff to help humans tell different types
of computers how to do the same things.</p>
<h1 id="use-the-source-luke">Use the Source, Luke</h1>
<p><img src="../img/yoda.png" alt=""></p>
<p>These days most all code is written.</p>
<p>A <strong><em>character</em></strong> is a letter, number, symbol or space that you can type.</p>
<p>A <strong><em>text file</em></strong> is a file with letters, numbers, spaces and other characters
in it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Source code</em></strong> is the text that goes into one or more <strong><em>text files</em></strong> that
make up your program. Sometimes these files can be run as a program by
themselves.  These are called <strong><em>scripts</em></strong>. Sometimes <strong><em>source code</em></strong> files are
turned into other files that the computer can understand better and faster
than what you could ever type in. Making these computer-friendly files
is called <strong><em>compiling</em></strong> your code. Computers can understand some compiled
code directly and some still needs an <strong><em>interpreter</em></strong>. Just like humans,
computers sometimes need help interpreting one language into something
they understand. Like in real-life, it is faster for the computer when
an interpreter is not needed, but sometimes speed isn&#39;t as important as
being able to easily work with code that humans and many different types of
computers can understand.</p>
<p>A <strong><em>script</em></strong> is <strong><em>source code</em></strong> that can be run as a program.</p>
<p>An <strong><em>editor</em></strong> is a app used to change stuff in a file, for example, to create
a new <code>hello</code> program or edit a <code>server.properties</code> file to change
a Minecraft world to super flat.</p>
<p>A <strong><em>screen-oriented editor</em></strong> is an editor that doesn&#39;t need a mouse to
use. Since we are writing all our programs from a <strong><em>Linux terminal</em></strong>
(like professionals) we will use <strong><em>vi</em></strong> (or <strong><em>vim</em></strong>) a famous <strong><em>editor</em></strong> used
by great programmers since before the Internet was invented. <strong><em>vi</em></strong>
is on every UNIX/Linux computer there is.  This makes it a very useful
tool to learn.</p>
<h1 id="creating-code-with-vim">Creating Code with VIM</h1>
<p><img src="../img/vim-logo.png" alt="vim"></p>
<p><code>vi</code> is an ancient <strong><em>text editor</em></strong>, almost the first, (which I think was
<code>ed</code>). Ironically it holds its position as the Stradivarius of editors
&mdash; especially now that <code>vim</code> has improved it.  Its power comes from
its ubiquity. You can find <code>vi</code> on <em>every</em> UNIX/Linux/Solaris/AIX/BSD/Mac
system in the world by default (no it isn&#39;t on Windows, which is all you
really need to know about Windows to choose not to use it as a developer
unless forced).</p>
<p>Here are the survival essentials you need to master at this point. You
will learn many more as you grow into this powerful editor:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>vi hello</code> - create and open a new file called <code>hello</code></li>
<li><code>i</code> - switch to <code>INSERT</code> mode (look in bottom left)</li>
<li><code>&lt;arrows&gt;</code> - move around (easiest for beginners)</li>
<li><code>&lt;esc&gt;</code> - escape out of <code>INSERT</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;esc&gt;u</code> - undo, which you can repeat</li>
<li><code>ZZ</code> or <code>:q</code> - save and exit</li>
<li><code>ZQ</code> or <code>:q!</code> - just quit without saving</li>
<li><code>:w</code> - save without exiting</li>
</ul>
<p>The secret for beginners is the arrows. Eventually you will use <code>INSERT</code>
mode less and less.</p>
<p>Now you are ready to start creating files with vi.</p>
