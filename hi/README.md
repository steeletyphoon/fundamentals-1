# Hi You!

This program is a more personalized version of `hello` that prompts
the user for a name before saying hello. The goal of the project
is to learn how to prompt users for information that they type in,
which is a core part of any interactive command-line script including
the `eightball` program we'll make later. It is also obviously a
core part of any sort of interactive story or text adventure game
such as the [storyeng](http://storyeng.skilstak.io) games
we will make in [Python-2](http://python-2.skilstak.io) and
[Python-3](http://python-3.skilstak.io).
