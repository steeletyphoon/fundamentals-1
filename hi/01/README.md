## "What's your name?"

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

print("Hi, what's your name?")
```

First let's just do the same thing we did to begin `hello` by just
printing something out. In fact, you can just `cp hello hi` if you want
to save yourself the `chmod u+x hi` command since the proper permissions
have already been set on hello.

Notice that we use `"` instead of `'` because the `what's` already used
a `'` and it would mess it up. Python let's you use either `'` or `"`
for strings and they don't have different functions (as they do in some
other programming languages).
