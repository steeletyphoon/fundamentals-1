## Prompting for Input

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

print("Hi, what's your name?")
input('--> ')
```

Now let's get some input from the user. The `input()` function makes
our program wait for the user to type something in and press the
enter key. Whatever we pass to the function inside of the parentheses
(or *parens*) `()` will be printed to the screen to let the user know
to type something in. This is called a *prompt*. There's also a fancy
name for the stuff we pass into the parenthesis like coins in a soda
machine. *Parameters* is what computer scientists call them (the rest
of us say *params*).
