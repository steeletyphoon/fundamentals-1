## "Nice to meet you."

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

print("Hi, what's your name?")
name = input('--> ')
print('Nice to meet you, ' + name + '!')
```

Now let's do something more useful with the `name` variable. Don't forget
the space after the word *you* **inside of the string** because that will
keep the name from being too close.
