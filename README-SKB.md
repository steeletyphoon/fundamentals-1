# SkilStak Content Block™

[![][logo]][scb] [![][cc0]][cc0link]

This repo is a SkilStak Content Block™ designed to become a pseudo-user
home directory (named the same as repo) on a Linux terminal server,
virtual machine, or Raspberry Pi. Normally teachers login as the
pseudo-user and present the content during class. This is why you will
find files and directories such as `.vim`, `bin`, and `.bashrc` here as
well as . Students and teachers can browse, clone, or download any block
repo as a zip from GitHub to use locally on their own computers. The
content in this block is released under CC0 Public Domain and visible
to anyone. Teachers will need to adopt assessment strategies that take
this into account. We'd love to hear from you if you have suggestions
or contribution ideas.
