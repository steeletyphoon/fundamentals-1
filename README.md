# Learning to Program, in Python

[![][logo]][scb] [![][cc0]][cc0link]

This repo is a [SkilStak Content Block&trade;][scb] designed to become a
pseudo-user home directory (named the same as repo) on a Linux terminal
server, virtual machine, or [Raspberry Pi][]. Normally teachers login
as the pseudo-user and present the content during class.  Students and
teachers can browse, clone, or download any block repo as a zip from
GitHub to use locally on their own computers. The content in this
block is released under [CC0 Public Domain][cc0link] and visible to
anyone. Teachers will need to adopt assessment strategies that take this
into account. We'd love to [hear from you][] if you have suggestions or
contribution ideas.

## About

This course follows on and reemphasizes the skills and concepts introduced
in [Python-0](http://skilstak.github.io/python-0), which is designed to be
a simple introduction. In Python-1 students learn to program, in Python.
The fact that the language is Python is important, but secondary to
learning programming fundamentals such as variables, operators, blocks,
loops, data types, lists, dictionaries, exceptions, functions and module
use. Python-1 focuses on basic structured and procedural programming
paradigms. Important object-oriented concepts are introduced in Python-2,
which is sometimes offered with Python-1 in an accelerated course.

**Tier:** Project<br>
**Hours:** 24<br>
**Age:** 7+<br>
**SkilStaks:** All<br>
**Prerequisites:** Python-0

## Planning

Students taking this course will spend 90 minutes per class for 16
weeks focusing on developing several projects that can be customized and
expanded outside of class. As new concepts are covered students go back
to previous projects and apply them to what they have done before.

This schedule is designed for students as young as seven who have typing
skills. More advanced and/or older students might elect to combine
Python-1 and Python-2 into a single course.

## Assessment

Assessment is informal through weekly verbal quiz questions and SkilBux
rewards for terms and concepts remembered week to week. All students save
their work to GitHub accounts where parents can assess their progress
themselves as well.
