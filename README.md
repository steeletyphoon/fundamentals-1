# Learning to Program, in Python

![](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-generic.svg)

Meet Python, the best first programming language anyone should learn.
It is approachable, easy, and &mdash; most of all &mdash; real. Python is
a core language used by the worldwide scientific community – including
MIT where it is the first language taught – and can be found everywhere
from elementary schools to Hollywood. In this course students find out
what coding is, why they should learn it, and how to write their first
Python code the way most professionals do, with the vim text editor
from a Linux Bash command line. (You won't find any IDLE here.)

Students gradually learn the same habits, tools, and workflows associated
with college CS programs and technical careers. Young or old, this is
everyone's best first experience with real programming. Students learn
programming fundamentals such as variables, operators, blocks, loops,
data types, lists, dictionaries, functions, exceptions and module
use. Python-1 focuses on basic structured and procedural programming
paradigms. Important code management, functional (comprehensions),
object-oriented concepts are introduced in Python-2.

# Planning

This course takes a total of 24 hours to complete and is designed
to fit into 16 weeks of 90-minute classes (a semester) or two, 4-day weeks of
3-hour classes (ex: 9:30 - 12:30, Monday - Thursday).

The pace is set to what an average 8-12 year-old with typing skills can
accomplish within 70 minutes of a 90 minute class. Bonus challenges are
available for faster and older learners increasing the age range to about 18.
Keep in mind, however, that adults are also challenged by this material
(even if they don't get the pop references).

The last two weeks are a review of all the previous material. Avoid the
temptation to skip the final review since it ensures students are ready to
progress.

**Week 1:** [hello](/hello) - vim, `chmod`, `#!`, strings, functions, `print()`, `import colors`, `+`<br>
**Week 1:** [hi](/hi) - `input()`, variables, assignment, operators, `=`<br>
**Week 2:** [nyan](/nyan) - infinite loops, `while`, code blocks, `<control>-c`, `top`<br>
**Week 3:** [waffles](/waffles) - nested code blocks, conditions, `if/else`, <br>
**Week 4:** [dice](/dice) - lists, loops compared, implicit vs explicit, `'''`,`.append()`,`import random`,`random.choice()`<br>
**Week 5:** [badgers](/badgers)<br>
**Week 6:** [eightball](/eightball)<br>
**Week 7:** [bridge](/bridge) (utils.py)<br>
**Week 8:** [bridge](/bridge)<br>
**Week 9:** [mtable](/mtable)<br>
**Week 10:** [madforms](/madforms)<br>
**Week 11:** [madforms](/madforms)<br>
**Week 12:** [bincount](/bincount)<br>
**Week 13:** [quiz](/quiz)<br>
**Week 14:** [quiz](/quiz)<br>
**Week 15:** [review](/review)<br>
**Week 16:** [review](/review)<br>

# Resources and Requirements

Students need access to a Linux command-line on a computer that has had
`python3` installed. Usually this will be through an ssh connection
(putty, etc.) to a Linux account on a school server. This could equally
be done with individual [Raspberry Pi][] computers, individual Linux
real or virtual machines, or a remote virtual host such as Digital Ocean.
