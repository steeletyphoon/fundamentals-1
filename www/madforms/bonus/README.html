<h1>Bonus MadForms</h1><p>This version allows many madforms to be written and placed in the
<code>madforms.d</code> directory where they are either randomly selected or
specifically selected by a command-line argument. This version adds
a <code>-l</code> as well to list all the available madforms to pick from. If
<code>search_system</code> is set this version will look in every user home directory
for a readable <code>madforms.d</code> directory or <code>repos/madforms.d</code> directory or
<code>repos/python-1/madforms.d</code> directory. If found the <code>.form</code> files there
will be added to the available list of madforms. This version also adds
a prompt to save the filled form as a file that can be emailed, etc.</p>
