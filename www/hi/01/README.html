<h2>&quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot;</h2><pre><code class="language-python">#!/usr/bin/env python3

print(&quot;Hi, what&#39;s your name?&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>First let&#39;s just do the same thing we did to begin <code>hello</code> by just
printing something out. In fact, you can just <code>cp hello hi</code> if you want
to save yourself the <code>chmod u+x hi</code> command since the proper permissions
have already been set on hello.</p>
<p>Notice that we use <code>&quot;</code> instead of <code>&#39;</code> because the <code>what&#39;s</code> already used
a <code>&#39;</code> and it would mess it up. Python let&#39;s you use either <code>&#39;</code> or <code>&quot;</code>
for strings and they don&#39;t have different functions (as they do in some
other programming languages).</p>
