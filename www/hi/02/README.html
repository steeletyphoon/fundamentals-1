<h2>Prompting for Input</h2><pre><code class="language-python">#!/usr/bin/env python3

print(&quot;Hi, what&#39;s your name?&quot;)
input(&#39;--&gt; &#39;)
</code></pre>
<p>Now let&#39;s get some input from the user. The <code>input()</code> function makes
our program wait for the user to type something in and press the
enter key. Whatever we pass to the function inside of the parentheses
(or <em>parens</em>) <code>()</code> will be printed to the screen to let the user know
to type something in. This is called a <em>prompt</em>. There&#39;s also a fancy
name for the stuff we pass into the parenthesis like coins in a soda
machine. <em>Parameters</em> is what computer scientists call them (the rest
of us say <em>params</em>).</p>
