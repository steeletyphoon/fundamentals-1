<h1>Hi</h1><p><img src="http://skilstak.github.io/images/skilstak-hi.png" alt="SkilStak Hi"></p>
<p><strong>Approximate Time:</strong> 30 minutes</p>
<p>This program is a more personalized version of <a href="../hello">hello</a> that
prompts the user for a name before saying hello. The goal of the
project is to learn how to prompt users for information that they type in,
which is a core part of any interactive command-line script including the
<a href="../eightball">eightball</a> program we&#39;ll make later. It is also obviously
a core part of any sort of interactive story or text adventure game such as
the <a href="http://github.com/storyeng">storyeng</a> games we will make in
<a href="http://github.com/skilstak/python-1">Python-1</a> and 
<a href="http://github.com/skilstak/python-2">Python-2</a>.</p>
<h2>hi1</h2><pre><code class="language-python">#!/usr/bin/env python3

print(&quot;Hi, what&#39;s your name?&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>First let&#39;s just do the same thing we did to begin <a href="../hello">hello</a> by just
printing something out. In fact, you can just <code>cp hello hi</code> if you want to
save yourself the <code>chmod u+x hi</code> command since the proper permissions have
already been set on hello.</p>
<p>Notice that we use <code>&quot;</code> instead of <code>&#39;</code> because the <code>what&#39;s</code> already used
a <code>&#39;</code> and it would mess it up. Python let&#39;s you use either <code>&#39;</code> or <code>&quot;</code>
for strings and they don&#39;t have different functions (as they do in some
other programming languages).</p>
<h2>hi2</h2><pre><code class="language-python">#!/usr/bin/env python3

print(&quot;Hi, what&#39;s your name?&quot;)
input(&#39;--&gt; &#39;)
</code></pre>
<p>Now let&#39;s get some input from the user. The <code>input()</code> function makes
our program wait for the user to type something in and press the
enter key. Whatever we pass to the function inside of the parentheses
(or <em>parens</em>) <code>()</code> will be printed to the screen to let the user know
to type something in. This is called a <em>prompt</em>. There&#39;s also a fancy
name for the stuff we pass into the parenthesis like coins in a soda
machine. <em>Parameters</em> is what computer scientists call them (the rest
of us say <em>params</em>).</p>
<h2>hi3</h2><pre><code class="language-python">#!/usr/bin/env python3

print(&quot;Hi, what&#39;s your name?&quot;)
name = input(&#39;--&gt; &#39;)
print(name)
</code></pre>
<p>Now we add a <code>name</code> variable that will have whatever the user typed
inside of it so we can use it later.  The <code>input()</code> function is like
a machine that spits something out. When a function does this we call
it <em>returning</em> a value. We store that returned value into <code>name</code> by
assigning it just like we did color codes in <a href="../hellow">hello</a>.</p>
<p>To make sure all this plumbing is working we are going to just print
the <code>name</code> variable. <code>print()</code> is universally used to test code so
we can see what is going on &mdash; especially when things get more
complicated. Often this is referred to as a <em>debug print statement</em>. There
are much fancier ways to debug, (which means to track down problems),
in code. But the old reliable <code>print()</code> statement is always there to
help us out. We&#39;ll delete it later once we know our code is working.</p>
<p>Using all our fancy new words for things we can describe <code>name =
input(&#39;--&gt;&#39;)</code> as a line of code that calls the <em>function</em> <code>input()</code> and
passes a single <em>string</em> as a <em>param</em> for the <em>prompt</em> and <em>returns</em>
another <em>string</em> containing what the user typed into the <code>name</code>
<em>variable</em>. By now that sentence should make sense enough to not sound
like some coder-geek foreign language. Yes, face the reality, YOU are
becoming a geek. Just own it and start imagining how you will soon use
your new superpower for good. Oh, and don&#39;t forget to go outside once
in a while.</p>
<h2>hi4</h2><pre><code class="language-python">#!/usr/bin/env python3

print(&quot;Hi, what&#39;s your name?&quot;)
name = input(&#39;--&gt; &#39;)
print(&#39;Nice to meet you, &#39; + name + &#39;!&#39;)
</code></pre>
<p>Now let&#39;s do something more useful with the <code>name</code> variable. Don&#39;t forget
the space after the word <em>you</em> <strong>inside of the string</strong> because that will
keep the name from being too close.</p>
<h2>hi5</h2><pre><code class="language-python">#!/usr/bin/env python3

import colors as c

print(c.clear)
print(c.yellow + &quot;Hi, what&#39;s your name?&quot;)
name = input(c.orange + &#39;--&gt; &#39;)
print(c.yellow + &#39;Well &#39; + name + &#39;, nice to meet you.&#39;)
</code></pre>
<p>Time to color things up now that the base program is working. We&#39;ll add
a new special &#39;color&#39; that isn&#39;t really a color at all. It clears the
screen when you print it like the other colors.</p>
<p>Notice that the last line is all yellow. Can you think of a way to make</p>
<h2>hi6</h2><pre><code class="language-python">#!/usr/bin/env python3

import colors as c

print(c.clear + c.yellow + &quot;Hi, what&#39;s your name?&quot;)
name = input(c.orange + &#39;--&gt; &#39;)
print(c.yellow + &#39;Well &#39; + name + &#39;, nice to meet you.&#39;)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, can you figure out how to make the <code>--&gt;</code> prompt a different color than
what the user types in? Give it a try before you proceed.</p>
<h2>hi7</h2><pre><code class="language-python">#!/usr/bin/env python3

import colors as c

print(c.clear + c.yellow + &quot;Hi, what&#39;s your name?&quot; + c.reset)
name = input(&#39;--&gt; &#39; + c.orange)
print(c.red + &#39;Well &#39; + c.magenta + name + c.red + &#39;, nice to meet you.&#39;)
</code></pre>
<p>Great job! You have completed <code>hi</code>. And by the way you can use <code>c.pink</code>
instead of <code>c.magenta</code> if it is easier to remember. Same with <code>c.purple</code>
and <code>c.violet</code>.</p>
