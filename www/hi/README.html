<h1>Hi There, You</h1><p><img src="http://skilstak.github.io/images/skilstak-hi.png" alt="SkilStak Hi"></p>
<p>This program is a more personalized version of <code>hello</code> that prompts
the user for a name before saying hello. The goal of the project
is to learn how to prompt users for information that they type in,
which is a core part of any interactive command-line script including
the <code>eightball</code> program we&#39;ll make later. It is also obviously a
core part of any sort of interactive story or text adventure game
such as the <a href="http://storyeng.skilstak.io">storyeng</a> games
we will make in <a href="http://python-2.skilstak.io">Python-2</a> and
<a href="http://python-3.skilstak.io">Python-3</a>.</p>
