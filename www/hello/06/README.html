<h2>Color Abbreviations (Short Names)</h2><p>To reduce the amount of typing and confusion when using colors short
forms of the color names are also available. <strong><em>Abbreviations</em></strong> are
when a longer word is made shorter by not writing it all out.</p>
<p>Keep in mind the abbreviation for <code>c.reset</code> is <code>c.x</code> since <code>c.r</code> is
already used for <code>c.red</code> and the <code>x</code> means &quot;turn off&quot;.</p>
