<h1>Step 1: Your First Program</h1><p>Let&#39;s start simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new file with <code>vi hello</code></li>
<li>Type <code>i</code> to change to <code>INSERT</code> mode in vi</li>
<li>Type <code>print(&quot;Hello world!&quot;)</code></li>
<li>Press <code>esc</code> (in the top left of keyboard) to change out of <code>INSERT</code> mode</li>
<li>Type <code>ZZ</code> (those are capital letters) to save and close the file</li>
<li>Type <code>python3 hello</code> to run your code</li>
<li>Mark this calendar day as your <strong><em>code birthday</em></strong> (if your first code)</li>
</ol>
<p>This program has two parts: </p>
<ol>
<li>A <strong><em>function call</em></strong>: <code>print()</code></li>
<li>A <strong><em>string parameter</em></strong>: <code>&quot;Hello world!&quot;</code></li>
</ol>
<p>A <strong><em>function call</em></strong> is an action, a way to make the computer do something,
like print something to the screen. Many words in programming, like
<strong><em>function</em></strong>, get names from math, so pay attention in math class if you
want to be a better programmer.</p>
<p>A <strong><em>string parameter</em></strong> is what goes into the function call. This tells the
function what to print.</p>
<p>A <strong><em>string</em></strong> is a bunch of <strong><em>characters</em></strong>, letters, numbers, spaces and other
stuff strung together like beads on a bracelet or necklace and tied with
knots on the ends. The knots are <strong><em>quotes</em></strong> (<code>&quot;</code>). If you leave off a knot
the beads fall off and you get a <code>Syntax Error</code>, which is just Python&#39;s
way of helping you get it right. Make sure you read those errors carefully
even if they contain hard words to understand, they contain a lot of clues
about the problem, which you can even Google to get more help from other
humans on the Interwebz.</p>
