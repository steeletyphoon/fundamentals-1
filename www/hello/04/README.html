<h1>Clearing the Screen</h1><p>Terminals respond to special codes when they are printed to the
screen. All of the colors use these codes. One special code is
<strong><em>clear</em></strong> or <code>c.clear</code> or <code>c.cl</code> which will clear the screen when it
is printed. This is an extremely efficient way to wipe your screen clear
and starting printing something new to it. It is also very simple to use.</p>
<p>Join <code>c.clear</code> or <code>c.cl</code> to the beginning of your strings to try it.</p>
<p>Remember not to confuse <code>c.clear</code> with <code>c.reset</code>. The first clears the
screen. The second just stops the color from continuing resetting it
back to whatever the color was before.</p>
